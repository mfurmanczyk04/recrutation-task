Git issue tracker
Due to limited time to complete the task, which was additionaly reduced by my weekend trip I dicided to firstly
provide most important functionalites of the application. After building basic logic had some free time left, so I dicided
to perform complex refactor.

TODO: 
refactor githubService.cs to use the same function to edit/close issue
